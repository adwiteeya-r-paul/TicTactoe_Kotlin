# TicTacToe

I built this project to familiarize myself with Kotlin and Android Studio. A demo is available here: [https://github.com/adwiteeya-r-paul/TicTactoe_Kotlin/issues/1]

Other than determining win/draw, the app keeps track of the number of times the players have won in a particular session.
